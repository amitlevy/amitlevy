#### Important (if you're a recruiter):

Hi, this GitHub was meant to be used to showcase my projects, which is why almost everything has only an initial commit.
But, I haven't added anything new in a while, and my current projects are much more impressive than the ones that appear here.
I intend to update this account soon, but if I didn't by the time you look at it (which seems to be the case), please ignore it, the rest of my CV probably does a better job of showcasing what I've done.
