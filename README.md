Hi, this GitHub is meant to be used to showcase my projects, which is why almost everything has only an initial commit.
But, I haven't added anything new in a while, and my current projects are much more impressive than the ones that appear here.
I intend to update this account soon, but if I didn't by the time you look at it (which seems to be the case), please ignore it.
